# Phaser + Webpack + ES6 + Cordova project
Making your own game is a dream of many people, including myself, and with the amount of content we have available these days, it was never that easy to build one.

## About
This is a base project for your Phaser 3 + Webpack 4 + ES6 + ESlint + Cordova project
Of course this was only possible because of some amazing free/open source softwares available today. So I'd like to say a special thank you to:
- [lean/phaser-es6-webpack](https://github.com/lean/phaser-es6-webpack) and [ReydVires/phaser3-cordova](https://github.com/ReydVires/phaser3-cordova) for the base of this project
- [npm](https://github.com/npm/cli) for javascript packager managing
- [eslint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) for code linter
- [Phaser](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser) for the game engine
- [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) to build and run the Javascript environment
- [cordova](https://github.com/apache/cordova) for packing the Android APK file
- [Android Studio](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/tools/base/+/studio-master-dev/studio.md) to sign the APK file
